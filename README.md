# tennishack
Python script that uses selenium and a headless google chrome driver to automatically book my tennis and paddle courts. I got annoyed at trying to book the courts at exactly 8am when they opened, and ultimatley not having certainty. So I wrote a script to automate the process. Every Weds I have a paddle court booked and every weekday I have a tennis court booked for 7pm.
